# 2D-RPG-Platformer-Cplusplus-SDL2
An open source 2D RPG written in C++ and SDL2. This is mainly for my youtube followers, but you're more than welcome to grab the code a make a break for it, just be sure to disable the dart traps and avoid the hidden spike pits, you code-pirate. I use sublime text for my projects, which is what the Windows.sublime-project and Linux.sublime-project is all about. 
You'll need to setup mingw64 if your on Windows, and if you're on Linux just a quick 

sudo apt-get install g++ 

should be fine. You'll also have to setup SDL, so I recommend you check out my Youtube channel called codergopher. It will show you how to do just that, and who knows, you might even have a bit of fun, eh?
